The Prog24 is a free I2C EEPROM programmer tool for CH341A device based on [QhexEdit2](https://github.com/Simsys/qhexedit2) and
[ch341 c-programmer tools](https://github.com/command-tab/ch341eeprom).

This is a GUI program based on QhexEditor, which adds EEPROM read/write buttons and programmer information menu.
